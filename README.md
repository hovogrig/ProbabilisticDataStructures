Probabilistic Data Structures
Overview
This Java library provides a collection of probabilistic data structures for approximate data processing and memory-efficient computations. These data structures are designed to offer efficient solutions for tasks such as approximate counting, membership queries, and cardinality estimation in large datasets.

Features
Count-Min Sketch: Approximate counting of items in a stream with bounded error probabilities.
Bloom Filter: Probabilistic data structure for membership queries with false positive results.
HyperLogLog: Estimate the cardinality of a multiset with very low memory usage.
